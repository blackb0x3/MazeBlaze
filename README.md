# MazeBlaze
A second year project I completed at Telford College of Arts and Technology.

# AIM
To create a 2D fast-paced puzzle game that involves a player moving a ball
through a variety of coloured walls. For example: a white ball is able to
move through white walls, but not of any other colour (the same for green,
blue, red etc.). Grey "steel" walls cannot be penetrated regardless of the
ball's colour.
As the game progresses, extra obstacles are presented to the player, such
as avoiding spikes and collecting coins - before you can reach the finish
flag.

# INSPIRATION
The original game (MazeBlaze) was used for an individual 2nd year project
at college in May 2015. Using the OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
knowledge I gained from my first year of university. I decided to remake
the game so that it was more efficient and reused more code.

# LANGUAGES
C# - XNA Game Studio 4

# EXTRA NOTES
This project has almost been completed - a little bit of improvement on the
collision detection system between the wall and the ball is required. As 
well as that, it needs some more levels!
